## Description

Welcome to Type++! Looking to test out your overpriced custom keyboard? Wanna show off how much faster you can type than your buddies? Need to find out your words-per-minute speed for a job application? You’ve come to the right place!

Type++ is a competitive type-racing application that allows you to test your typing speed and compete both globally and with friends. As you play more and improve your speed and accuracy, you'll level up and earn badges to show off your skills.

The entire application – both front- and back-end – was built from the ground up using the below user story, acceptance criteria, APIs, and languages.

### User Story

```
AS A user who wants to test and improve their typing speed and accuracy
I WANT a quick, easy, and reliable way to test and track my typing skills
SO THAT I can benchmark my typing abilities, track my improvement over time, and how I measure up to friends and other competitors
```
